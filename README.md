# Cubic Spline Interpolation Project

This project demonstrates cubic spline interpolation using Python. It includes tools for generating natural cubic splines, testing polynomial operations, and visualizing results using matplotlib.

## Features

- Natural cubic spline interpolation with zero second derivatives at endpoints.
- Custom `Poly` and `PolyRange` classes for polynomial manipulation.
- Visualization of interpolated parametric curves.

## Usage

See `curve_fitting_example.py` for an example of 2D parametric curve fitting using cubic splines.
